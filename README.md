#Our Project
Our project will generate citi-bike tours to various landmarks and
points of interest. We'll over overlay the *Google Maps*, *Google Places*, and 
*Citi Bike* APIs to highlight possible destinations, find the nearest bike
depots, and plot an optimal route between desired locations.

#Backend
Google Maps: Connect a set of given points using the shortest path. Display map.
Google Places: Find nearest landmarks, using user input for type (museum, nightclub, etc). Order them by distance. 
Citibike: Given a location, find the nearest citibike hub.
