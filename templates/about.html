<h3> The App </h3>
<p align= "left", font color="black"> With over 50 million visitors annually, New York City is the #1 tourism destination in the US and one of the top 5 in the world. Tourists can travel independently, a difficult process, or pay expensive rates for tour guides/groups. These options are detrimental to the environment because they either involve private vehicles or gas-guzzling buses.</p>
<br>
<p align = "left">
<b> Bike & Seek </b> provides tourists with easily accessible bikes from local bike sharing locations, prepackaged and coordinated tours of New York’s most popular attractions and hidden gems. Our mission is to reduce the environmental footprint of the tourism industry, increase tourism revenue for local tourist attractions, and create a fun, memorable, free experience for tourists.
<br>
<br>

Our service allows you to create custom tours,  select from highly rated tours created by others, or chose from our own premade tours. Your tours can be bike tours (our specialty!), walking tours, or tours which use public transportation.

<h3> Free Independent Travers </h3>
<p align = "left"> The tourism industry is witnessing a rise in the popularity of the “free independent traveler” (FIT). As tourists move away from traditional travel packages and tour groups. We're here to provide FITs  with helpful assistance and unlimited freedom. </p>
