		<h2 id="about_3"> About us</h2><br>
		<p>
		With over 50 million visitors annually, New York City is the #1 tourism destination in the US and one of the 
		top 5 in the world. Tourists can travel independently, a difficult process, or pay expensive rates for tour guides/groups. 
		These options are detrimental to the environment because they either involve private vehicles or gas-guzzling buses. 
		Tour-De-City provides tourists with easily accessible bikes from local bike sharing locations, prepackaged and 
		coordinated tours of New Yorkâ€™s most popular attractions and hidden gems. Our mission is to reduce the environmental footprint of the tourism industry, increase tourism revenue for local tourist attractions, and creating a fun, memorable experience.
